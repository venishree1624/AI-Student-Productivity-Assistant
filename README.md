# AI Student Productivity Assistant

## Overview
**This project was developed as part of the Microsoft Elevate Microsoft Copilot
Internship program.**

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an AI-powered
student productivity assistant using Microsoft Copilot. The assistant helps college students manage daily tasks, plan weekly schedules,
prioritize work based on urgency, and handle multiple deadlines effectively.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to improve student productivity by providing
structured task planning, time management strategies, and deadline-focused
workflows using AI assistance.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Copilot (Chat-based AI)
- Web Browser

## Implementation Approach
Due to limited access to Copilot Studio, the AI agent was implemented and
simulated using Microsoft Copilot chat by defining a fixed agent role,
responsibilities, and structured productivity workflows.

The agent was tested through multiple real-world scenarios such as:
- Daily task planning
- Weekly productivity scheduling
- Task prioritization
- Deadline management

## Project Demonstration
Screenshots demonstrating the AI agent workflows and outputs are available
in the `screenshots` folder.

All prompts used for this project are documented in the `prompts` folder for
reference and reproducibility.

## Future Scope
In the future, this project can be extended by implementing the same agent
using Microsoft Copilot Studio for full deployment and automation.
